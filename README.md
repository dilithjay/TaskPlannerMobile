# Task Planner Mobile
Task Planner is a mobile app that can be used to manage and plan tasks. It supports the addition of different kinds of tasks such as regular tasks and daily tasks, and also supports deleting or archiving tasks. For daily tasks, the app keeps track of a completion streak to act as an incentive to complete tasks, regularly.

* A daily task is a task that are required to be completed daily. Examples of this include tasks such as exercising, meditating, practice an instrument, etc.
* Each daily task has something known as a `streak`. It is shown within a circle on the task card. A `streak` represents the number of consecutive days during which the individual has completed a given task. Missing a day would reset the streak to 0.
